# MachineLearning-Project1-KNN
Today I am sharing my new project of Machine learning. In which I find a real-world application/use of  KNN and Illustrate the the idea of the algorithm by using the example. The real world application is Breast Cancer Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) , go through my project as I explained KNN in my first few slides and then the application.
